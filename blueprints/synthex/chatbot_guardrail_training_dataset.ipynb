    "# Generating a training dataset for a Chatbot Guardrail Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use [Synthex](https://github.com/tanaos/synthex) to generate a training dataset for a Chatbot Guardrail Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chatbot Guardrail models\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrail models are tools that help to ensure the safe and reliable output of Chatbot and other AI systems, **preventing them from generating responses that may be harmful or unwanted**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say, for instance, that by means of a cunning stratagem, the user manages to [trick a Chatbot into selling him a car for 1$](https://www.upworthy.com/prankster-tricks-a-gm-dealership-chatbot-to-sell-him-a-76000-chevy-tahoe-for-ex1#), into [granting a discount on an airline ticket](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-february/bc-tribunal-confirms-companies-remain-liable-information-provided-ai-chatbot/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), or simply into making an inappropriate remark or discussing topics that go beyond the chatbot's sphere of competence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, a Guardrail Model would realize the mistake before it reaches the user and replace the response with a safe one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we will see how to generate a **training dataset** for a Guardrail Model that will be applied to a **Chatbot that's on the website of an online store**. In particular, the Guardrail Model should ensure that the Chatbot **does not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discuss anything that is not related to the online store or one of its products\n",
    "2. Suggest that the user visit a competitor's store\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot is allowed to discuss anything that does not fall under either of those two categories.\n",
    "\n",
