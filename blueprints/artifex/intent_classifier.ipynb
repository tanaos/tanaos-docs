    "\n",
    "Intent Classifier models are used to classify the intent (or goal) of a sentence into predefined categories, such as **send_email**, **schedule_meeting**, **cancel_meeting** or anything else. They are commonly used in chatbots and virtual assistants to understand what the user is trying to achieve.\n",

    "In the following example, we will see how to generate an Intent Classifier Model that will be able to classify the intent of a user-provided sentence into one of the following categories:\n",
