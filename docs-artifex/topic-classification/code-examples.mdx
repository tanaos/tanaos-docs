# Topic Classification model

### Use the default Topic Classification model

Need a general-purpose Topic Classification model? You can use Artifex's default Topic Classification 
model, which is trained to recognize the following topics out-of-the-box:
- `politics`
- `health`
- `technology`
- `entertainment`
- `money_finance`
- `relationships_dating`
- `education_learning`
- `work_careers`
- `science`
- `society_culture`
- `gaming`
- `lifestyle_hobbies`
- `sports`
- `automotive`
- `other`

```python
from artifex import Artifex

topic_classification = Artifex().topic_classification

print(topic_classification("What do you think about the latest AI advancements?"))

# >>> [{'label': 'technology', 'score': 0.9910}]
```

Learn more about the default Topic Classification model on our [Topic Classification HF model page](https://huggingface.co/tanaos/tanaos-topic-classification-v1).

### Create & use a custom Topic Classification model

Need more control over the topics recognized, or do you want to tailor the model to your specific 
domain for better results? Fine-tune your own Topic Classification model, use it locally on CPU 
and keep it forever:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

topic_classification = Artifex().topic_classification

model_output_path = "./output_model/"

topic_classification.train(
    domain="messages posted on social media platforms", # change to your desired domain
    classes={ # define your custom topics
        "politics": "elections, policies, scandals, ideology",
        "sports": "games, teams, players, scores, championships",
        "personal_finance": "budgeting, saving, investing, debt management",
        "entertainment": "movies, music, celebrities, TV shows",
        "other": "miscellaneous topics not covered by the other categories."
    },
    output_path=model_output_path
)

topic_classification.load(model_output_path)
print(topic_classification("Who do you think will win the championship this year?"))

# >>> [{'label': 'sports', 'score': 0.9965}]
```
