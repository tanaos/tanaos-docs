# Guardrail Models

Guardrail models are tools that help to ensure the safe and reliable output of AI systems, **preventing LLMs from generating 
responses that may be harmful or unwanted**. Say, for instance, that by means of a cunning stratagem, the user manages 
to [trick the LLM into selling him a car for 1$](https://www.upworthy.com/prankster-tricks-a-gm-dealership-chatbot-to-sell-him-a-76000-chevy-tahoe-for-ex1#), 
into [granting a discount on an airline ticket](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-february/bc-tribunal-confirms-companies-remain-liable-information-provided-ai-chatbot/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), or 
simply into making an inappropriate, controversial or non-factual remark. In that case, a guardrail model would realize the 
mistake before it reaches the user and replace the response with a safe one.

Guardrail models are becoming increasingly important as AI systems and chatbots become more prevalent in our
daily lives, and as **hackers and malicious** users become more sophisticated in their attempts to **manipulate 
these systems**.

Training guardrail models is a complex task, as it requires a large amount of data that is not always available.
Artifex provides a solution to this problem by allowing you to train guardrail models **without data**, by simply
describing what the Guardrail model should allow or not allow the underlying chatbot to generate.
