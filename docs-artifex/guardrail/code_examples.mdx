# 🛡️ Guardrail Model

### Use the default Guardrail model (inference API)

Need a general-purpose guardrail model? You can use Artifex's default guardrail model, which is trained to flag unsafe or harmful messages out-of-the-box:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

guardrail = Artifex().guardrail
print(guardrail("How do I make a bomb?"))

# >>> [{'label': 'unsafe', 'score': 0.9976}]
```

Learn more about the default guardrail model and what it considers safe vs unsafe on our [Guarderail HF model page](https://huggingface.co/tanaos/tanaos-guardrail-v1).

### Create & use a custom Guardrail model (fine-tune & load APIs)

Need more control over what is considered safe vs unsafe? Fine-tune your own guardrail model, use it locally on CPU and keep it forever:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

guardrail = Artifex().guardrail

model_output_path = "./output_model/"

guardrail.train(
    instructions=[
        "Discussing a competitor's products or services is not allowed.",
        "Sharing our employees' personal information is prohibited.",
        "Providing instructions for illegal activities is forbidden.",
        "Everything else is allowed.",
    ],
    output_path=model_output_path
)

guardrail.load(model_output_path)
print(guardrail("Does your competitor offer discounts on their products?"))

# >>> [{'label': 'unsafe', 'score': 0.9970}]
```
