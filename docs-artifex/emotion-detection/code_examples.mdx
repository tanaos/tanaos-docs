# 😡 Emotion Detection model

### Use the default Emotion Detection model

Need a general-purpose Emotion Detection model? You can use Artifex's default Emotion Detection 
model, which is trained to recognize eight emotions out-of-the-box:
- `joy`
- `anger`
- `fear`
- `sadness`
- `surprise`
- `disgust`
- `excitement`
- `neutral`

```python
from artifex import Artifex

emotion_detection = Artifex().emotion_detection

print(emotion_detection("I am absolutely thrilled with the results of my project."))

# >>> [{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9916}]
```

Learn more about the default Emotion Detection model on our [Emotion Detection HF model page](https://huggingface.co/tanaos/tanaos-emotion-detection-v1).

### Create & use a custom Emotion Detection model

Need more control over the emotions recognized, or do you want to tailor the model to your specific 
domain for better results? Fine-tune your own Emotion Detection model, use it locally on CPU 
and keep it forever:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

emotion_detection = Artifex().emotion_detection

model_output_path = "./output_model/"

emotion_detection.train(
    domain="customer support for an e-commerce platform",
    classes={
        "joy": "text that expresses happiness or positivity",
        "anger": "text that expresses anger or frustration",
        "sadness": "text that expresses sadness or sorrow",
        "surprise": "text that expresses surprise or shock",
        "disgust": "text that expresses disgust or revulsion",
        "excitement": "text that expresses excitement or enthusiasm",
        "neutral": "text that either expresses a neutral or indifferent emotion, or that does not express any emotion at all on account of being purely factual or descriptive."
    },
    output_path=model_output_path
)

emotion_detection.load(model_output_path)
print(emotion_detection("This is unacceptable, I want a refund!"))

# >>> [{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.9965}]
```
