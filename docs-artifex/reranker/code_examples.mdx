# Reranker model

### Use the default Reranker model

Need a general-purpose Reranker model? You can use Artifex's default Reranker model, which is 
trained to rank items based on relevance out-of-the-box:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

reranker = Artifex().reranker

ranked_documents = reranker(
    query="Best programming language for data science",
    documents=[
        "Java is a versatile language typically used for building large-scale applications.",
        "Python is widely used for data science due to its simplicity and extensive libraries.",
        "JavaScript is primarily used for web development.",
    ]
)
print(ranked_documents)

# >>> [('Python is widely used for data science due to its simplicity and extensive libraries.', 3.83454), ('Java is a versatile language typically used for building large-scale applications.', -0.83086), ('JavaScript is primarily used for web development.', -1.37813)]
```

Learn more about the default Reranker model on the [Reranker HF model page](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1).

### Create & use a custom Reranker model

Want to fine-tune the Reranker model on a specific domain for better accuracy? Fine-tune your own 
Reranker model, use it locally on CPU and keep it forever:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

reranker = Artifex().reranker

model_output_path = "./output_model/"

reranker.train(
    domain="e-commerce product search", # change to your desired domain
    output_path=model_output_path
)

reranker.load(model_output_path)
print(reranker(
    query="Laptop with long battery life",
    documents=[
        "A powerful gaming laptop with high-end graphics and performance.",
        "An affordable laptop suitable for basic tasks and web browsing.",
        "This laptop features a battery life of up to 12 hours, perfect for all-day use.",
    ]
))
