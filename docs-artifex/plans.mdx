# Plans

We have made Artifex free to use within certain limits. Beyond these limits, you can opt for a pay-as-you-go plan.

## How pricing works

Pricing in Artifex is based on the number of training datapoints you use. As explained 
in the <Link to={ARTIFEX_INTRO_URL}>introduction section</Link>, creating a model with Artifex **does not** require that you provide
any training data, because synthetic training data is generated under the hood. 

When you train any model, you can specify how many training datapoints you want to use. The more datapoints you use, the better 
the model will be, but also the more time it will take to train it (and the more expensive it will be 🤑). For most purposes, 
using between 300 and 500 training datapoints is enough to get good results.

## Free plan

The free plan is mainly aimed at individual users and small projects. Each user enjoys **1500 training datapoints per month** and 
**500 training datapoints per job** for free; this is enough to train 3-5 good-performing models per month for free.

## Pay-as-you-go

The pay-as-you-go plan is aimed at professional users and larger projects. It has no monthly limit, you simply pay for what you use. 
To use it, you need to:

1. create an account on <a href={PLATFORM_BASE_URL} target='_blank' rel='noopener'>our platform</a>
2. add credits to it
3. create an Api Key and pass it to Artifex at instantiation, then use it normally:

    ```python
    from artifex import Artifex

    guardrail = Artifex(api_key="<your-api-key>").guardrail
    ```

Your credits will be deducted as you use the service, in the measure of **1$ per 100 datapoints**.

## Automatic downgrade to free plan

If you finish your credits, the following will happen:

- If you have not exceeded the monthly limit, you will be **automatically switched to the free plan**.
- If you have exceeded the monthly limit, you will not be able to create new models until the next month, when your monthly 
quota will be reset.
