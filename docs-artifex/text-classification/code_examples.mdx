# Text Classification model

<InfoBox type='warning'>
    Unlike most other tasks that can be performed with Artifex, Text Classification **does 
    not** come with a pre-trained model that can be used out-of-the-box. This is because
    Text Classification is a general task that can be applied to a wide variety of domains
    and use-cases, each requiring different classes to be recognized. Therefore, users
    need to train their own Text Classification models 
    using [the `train` method](/artifex/text-classification/train).
</InfoBox>

Train your own Text Classification model, use it locally on CPU and keep it forever:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

model_output_path = "./output_model/"

text_classification = Artifex().text_classification

text_classification.train(
    domain="chatbot conversations",
    classes={
        "politics": "Messages related to political topics and discussions.",
        "sports": "Messages related to sports events and activities.",
        "technology": "Messages about technology, gadgets, and software.",
        "entertainment": "Messages about movies, music, and other entertainment forms.",
        "health": "Messages related to health, wellness, and medical topics.",
    },
    output_path=model_output_path
)

text_classification.load(model_output_path)

print(text_classification("What do you think about the latest AI advancements?"))
