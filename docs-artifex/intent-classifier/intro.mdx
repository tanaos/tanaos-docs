# Intent Classifier Models

The Intent Classifier is a model that can be used to **classify the intent** (or goal) of an input sentence 
into any one of a number of user-defined categories. It is useful for applications such as chatbots, where 
you want to **understand the user's intent** based on their input. The model can be trained to recognize any 
type of intent, such as sending an email, scheduling a meeting, asking for information, or anything else.
