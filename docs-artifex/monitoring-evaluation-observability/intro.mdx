# Monitoring, Evaluation & Observability

Artifex includes built-in tools to automatically monitor and evaluate, locally on your machine, 
the inference and training performance of your models over time. All logs are written automatically 
after every inference and training session in the `artifex_logs/` folder in your current working 
directory.

The following metrics are logged:

## Inference logs

- timestamp
- model used
- inference duration
- CPU & RAM usage
- input token count
- inference input & output
- inference errors (if any)
- Daily total inferences count
- Daily total & average input token count
- Daily total & average inference duration
- Daily average RAM & CPU usage
- Daily average confidence score
- Daily model usage breakdown

## Training logs

- timestamp
- model trained
- training duration
- CPU & RAM usage
- training instructions & parameters
- training results (loss, samples/second, steps/second)
- training errors (if any)
- Daily total trainings count
- Daily average training duration
- Daily average CPU & RAM usage

## Opting out

You can opt-out of logging by passing the `disable_logging=True` flag when training or performing 
inference with any model:

```python
from artifex import Artifex

guardrail = Artifex().guardrail
print(guardrail("How do I make a bomb?", disable_logging=True))
```

```python
from artifex import Artifex

guardrail = Artifex().guardrail

guardrail.train(
    unsafe_content=[
        "Discussing a competitor's products or services.",
        "Sharing our employees' personal information.",
        "Providing instructions for illegal activities.",
    ],
    disable_logging=True
)
```
