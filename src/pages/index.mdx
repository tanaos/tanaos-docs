# Welcome to Tanaos Docs

<div style={{ marginTop: '3rem', marginBottom: '3rem' }}>
    At <Link to={WEBSITE_BASE_URL}>Tanaos</Link>, we develop tools that allow anyone to create 
    task-specific LLMs without training data, for offline NLP and Text Classification tasks, 
    such as Guardrail Models and Intent Classification 🤖🚀.

    We have created two open-source Python libraries to achieve this:
    - [Synthex](/synthex/intro): A library for generating large, high-quality synthetic datasets for any purpose.
    - [Artifex](/artifex/intro): A Python library to create task-specific LLMs without training data, for offline NLP and Text Classification tasks, such as Guardrail Models and Intent Classification.
