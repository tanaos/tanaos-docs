# About Synthex

<div className='responsive-container'>
    <div className='text-container'>
        Synthex is an [open-source Python library](https://github.com/tanaos/synthex) for high-quality, large-scale synthetic 
        data generation developed by <a href={WEBSITE_BASE_URL} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Tanaos</a>. It was designed to be 
        easy to use and to provide a simple interface for generating synthetic data.

        Synthex was implemented by following the [REST standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST), revolves 
        around the concept of [Resources](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html), 
        returns JSON-encoded responses and HTTP response codes. If you are familiar with these notions, 
        understanding how the library works should be straightforward.
